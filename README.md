In this project, I developed a detailed database structure tailored for an online food delivery company. My design encompasses a wide range of entities such as restaurants, employees, customers, menu items, orders, marketing campaigns, and ratings. I meticulously crafted both conceptual and logical models to illustrate the intricate relationships between these entities. Additionally, I formulated various queries aimed at enhancing operational performance, optimizing revenue streams, ensuring quality control, deepening customer loyalty insights, evaluating membership benefits, making informed staffing decisions, assessing marketing initiatives, and boosting customer engagement. This database design is pivotal in streamlining operations, guiding strategic decision-making, and elevating customer satisfaction within the food delivery ecosystem.
